# SketchNets
Experimenting with different types of Convolutional neural network models.  

## Dependencies
- Tensorflow (gpu recommended)
- Numpy
- Opencv
- requests
- termcolor
- yaml

## Using the runner
To run every network example use `python runner.py --run_network_test=True`.
Working on adding ways to run single networks.

## Working on
- Finishing implementation of every sketch network
